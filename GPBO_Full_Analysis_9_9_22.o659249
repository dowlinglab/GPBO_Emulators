/afs/crc.nd.edu/user/m/mcarlozo/.conda/envs/Toy_Problem_env/lib/python3.9/site-packages/gpytorch/lazy/triangular_lazy_tensor.py:130: UserWarning: torch.triangular_solve is deprecated in favor of torch.linalg.solve_triangularand will be removed in a future PyTorch release.
torch.linalg.solve_triangular has its arguments reversed and does not return a copy of one of the inputs.
X = torch.triangular_solve(B, A).solution
should be replaced with
X = torch.linalg.solve_triangular(A, B). (Triggered internally at  ../aten/src/ATen/native/BatchLinearAlgebra.cpp:1672.)
  res = torch.triangular_solve(right_tensor, self.evaluate(), upper=self.upper).solution
/afs/crc.nd.edu/user/m/mcarlozo/.conda/envs/Toy_Problem_env/lib/python3.9/site-packages/numpy/core/fromnumeric.py:86: FutureWarning: The input object of type 'Tensor' is an array-like implementing one of the corresponding protocols (`__array__`, `__array_interface__` or `__array_struct__`); but not a sequence (or 0-D). In the future, this object will be coerced as if it was first converted using `np.array(obj)`. To retain the old behaviour, you have to either modify the type 'Tensor', or assign to an empty array created with `np.empty(correct_shape, dtype=object)`.
