#Pseudo code for all 3-Input GP


Step 1) Generate Experimental and Training data (Completed)

NOTE: m = 1, n = 5, q = 3, t=t
--Generate Experimental data and training input data--
# Set  x values (m x n), noise_mean (float), and noise_stdev (float)
# Create experimental data using y = x -x^2 +x^3 + noise (1 x n)
# Generate training data inputs through LHS for Theta1,Theta2,and x (q x t)

--Generate training data outputs--
-- 2-Input GP (Side note)
# Generate input training data by only using Theta values from the LHS generation (the first 2 columns)
initialize SSE = np.zeros(len(theta combinations)) (1 x t)
loop over combinations of theta
    y_sim = Theta1*x + Theta2*x^2 +x^3 (1 x n)
    # Generate training data outputs using SSE[i] = SUM((y_exp - y_model)^2) (float)

-- 3-Input GP
# Generate training data outputs with y = Theta1*x + Theta2*x^2 +x^3 (1 x t)


Step 2) Pull Experimental and Training Data from the CSV (Completed)

#Read entire file with Pandas and convert to an array
#Create arrays for training/testing inputs and outputs based on data in stored files
#First row is an index, last row is output, all interior rows are inputs


Step 3) Train GP

# Define likelihood and GP model clas
# Train GP based on input training data z, and output training data y
# Switch to evaluation mode


Step 4) Generate meshgrid for Theta

Theta1 = np.linspace(-2,2,# points) (1 x p1)
Theta2 = np.linspace(-2,2,# points) (1 x p2)
theta_mesh = meshgrid (2 P1 x P2 arrays)


Step 5) Calculate Best Error and EI
