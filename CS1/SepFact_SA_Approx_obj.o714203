/afs/crc.nd.edu/user/m/mcarlozo/.conda/envs/Toy_Problem_env/lib/python3.9/site-packages/gpytorch/lazy/triangular_lazy_tensor.py:130: UserWarning: torch.triangular_solve is deprecated in favor of torch.linalg.solve_triangularand will be removed in a future PyTorch release.
torch.linalg.solve_triangular has its arguments reversed and does not return a copy of one of the inputs.
X = torch.triangular_solve(B, A).solution
should be replaced with
X = torch.linalg.solve_triangular(A, B). (Triggered internally at  ../aten/src/ATen/native/BatchLinearAlgebra.cpp:1672.)
  res = torch.triangular_solve(right_tensor, self.evaluate(), upper=self.upper).solution
/scratch365/mcarlozo/Toy_Problem/CS1/bo_plotters.py:754: RuntimeWarning: More than 20 figures have been opened. Figures created through the pyplot interface (`matplotlib.pyplot.figure`) are retained until explicitly closed and may consume too much memory. (To control this warning, see the rcParam `figure.max_open_warning`).
